# Classification models
## *Description*
Project focused on the application of different supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. The first part corresponds to the selection of a binary classification model 
using supervised learning algorithms (such as Logit, KNN, Adaboost, etc), using the data "xsimutest" from the data folder. The second part concerns the application of unsupervised learning algorithms with dimensionality reduction
(PCA, MCA) and clustering (K-means, hierarchical clustering), using the data "chiens" and "voitures" from the data folder.
